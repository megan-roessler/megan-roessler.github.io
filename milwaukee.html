		<h1>THE GOOD LAND</h1>

			<p>THIS NON-CONTIGUOUS map of major Milwaukee neighborhoods was made for my Graphic Design in Cartography class.
				My design process in many ways was driven by aesthetics. In this process, though, I reflected on the ways that 
				Milwaukee is both familiar and unfamiliar to me. Neighborhoods that I knew I wanted to include, like Miller Valley and the Third Ward
				were informed by my experiences of them. My choices in color coding the neighborhoods by their perception, whether they are known
				for arts, industry, or community, is again personal, and informed by my lived experience of the city.</p>
