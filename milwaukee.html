		<h1>THE GOOD LAND</h1>
		<div class="portfolio-blog">
			<p>This non-contiguous map of major Milwaukee neighborhoods was made for my Graphic Design in Cartography course.
				My design process in many ways was driven by aesthetics. In this process, though, I reflected on the ways that 
				Milwaukee is both familiar and unfamiliar to me. I enjoyed finding newways to look at places important to me, 
				like Murray Hill and the Third Ward, by creating a map that showed only their buildings and streets. My choice to color code the neighborhoods by their perception, whether they are known
				for arts, industry, or community, was similarly inspired by my lived experience of the city, and I enjoyed researching
				these neighborhoods to better understand them outside of my perspective.</p>
